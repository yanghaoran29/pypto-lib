# DeepSeek V4.1 Flash

`models/deepseek_v4_1_flash/` is the implementation staging area for the
DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash checkpoint. The first milestone establishes the text-model
configuration, layer schedule, cache ownership, inference metadata, Torch
goldens, and prefill/decode kernel contracts. Checkpoint loading and optimized
PyPTO leaf kernels remain follow-up work.

## Checkpoint shape

The `FLASH` preset in
[config.py](../../../models/deepseek_v4_1_flash/config.py) mirrors the released
checkpoint's 40-layer text backbone and quantization metadata. Auxiliary
drafting, n-gram, and multimodal components are intentionally out of scope.

| Property | Value |
| --- | ---: |
| Hidden size | 5,120 |
| Backbone layers | 40 |
| Attention heads | 64 |
| Head dimension | 512 |
| Routed experts / active experts | 384 / 6 |
| Shared experts | 1 |
| Hyper-connection width | 4 |
| Vocabulary | 129,280 |
| Maximum position | 1,048,576 |

The attention schedule is:

- Layers 0-1 use the 128-token sliding window only.
- Layers 2-19 use ratio-2 compressed sparse attention. KV sources are layers
  2, 8, and 14; those layers are also index sources.
- Layers 20-39 use ratio-1 compressed sparse attention. Layer 20 owns the KV
  cache, while layers 20, 24, 28, 32, and 36 refresh the index selection.

## Parallel-development structure

Each attention mode and execution phase has one ownership file. Every file
contains a Torch golden and an explicit `@pl.jit.inline` ABI; kernel bodies are
the remaining parallel work.

Run an operator file directly to execute its deterministic CPU golden:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate-pypto
python models/deepseek_v4_1_flash/decode_attn_c1a_reindex.py
```

The command prints `[GOLDEN] PASS` and exits nonzero when the reference fails.
Once a kernel body lands, its owner can extend the same file with the thin
`@pl.jit` entry, `build_tensor_specs()`, and device `run(...)` block.

| Hierarchical indexer | `hierarchical_sparse_indexer.py` |
| Hyper-connections | `hc_mixes.py`, `hc_pre.py`, `hc_post.py` |
| Attention TP transports | `attention_tp.py` |
| Shared Attention primitives | `attention_ops.py` (`make_mx_projection`, BF16 projection, RMSNorm, RoPE, and dependency-aware variants) |
| Shared Q/KV preprocessing | `qkv_proj_rope.py` (`q_proj_qr`, `q_proj_rope`, `kv_proj_rope`, `qkv_proj_rope` and Prefill variants) |
| Shared output projection | `o_proj.py` (`grouped_output`, `o_proj`, `prefill_o_proj`) |
| Expert parallelism | `moe.py` |
| Shared configuration and goldens | `config.py`, `metadata.py`, `golden.py`, `attention_common.py` |
| Quantization and RoPE tables | `quantization.py`, `rope_tables.py` |

SWA, C2A, and C1A use the shared Attention primitives and stage compositions
above. Decode C1A selects the dependency-aware variants because their explicit
TaskId edges are part of the hardware schedule, while retaining its distinct MX
projection implementation. It also uses `qkv_proj_rope_with_deps` and
`o_proj_with_deps` as the shared composition boundaries. The specialized
Prefill SWA Q-A projection also remains in
`qkv_proj_rope.py` because it preserves that path's group-32 scale decoding.

## Decode composition

[decode_layer_plan.py](../../../models/deepseek_v4_1_flash/decode_layer_plan.py)
resolves all six modes and source ownership from `FLASH.layer_config`. Each
mode has an independently executable Attention half-layer entry:

| Mode | Attention kernel | Composition entry | Representative layer |
| --- | --- | --- | ---: |
| SWA | `decode_attn_swa.py` | `decode_swa.py` | 0 |
| C2A Full | `decode_attn_c2a_full.py` | `decode_c2a_full.py` | 2 |
| C2A Reuse | `decode_attn_c2a_reuse.py` | `decode_c2a_reuse.py` | 3 |
| C1A Full | `decode_attn_c1a_full.py` | `decode_c1a_full.py` | 20 |
| C1A Reindex | `decode_attn_c1a_reindex.py` | `decode_c1a_reindex.py` | 24 |
| C1A Reuse | `decode_attn_c1a_reuse.py` | `decode_c1a_reuse.py` | 21 |

The mode files own their entry contract and readiness state. SWA and C2A use
the spec-driven boundary helpers in `decode_common.py`; C1A keeps its native
static token/page ABI and validation harness. `decode_layer.py` is the thin
complete Block integration entry. Its Torch golden preserves delayed pre-mix
ordering: Attention consumes the incoming mix, FFN consumes the Attention
pre-mix, and the Block returns the FFN pre-mix for the next layer. Run the six
small CPU Block references with:

```bash
python models/deepseek_v4_1_flash/decode_layer.py --stage block --cpu-golden
```

All six Attention half-layers are implemented. The full Block device path still
awaits EP8 MoE integration and its hardware fixture;
`decode_layer_kernel_skip_reason` reports that dependency. Both the Block
factory and `--stage block` device command enforce readiness before JIT
construction. Block CPU references currently require all capacity rows active.

Every mode file provides hardware validation without requiring MoE. The
`decode_layer.py --stage attention` compatibility dispatcher accepts the
spec-driven SWA/C2A ABI; C1A validation uses each mode's native entry directly.
For an allocated TP4 group:

```bash
python models/deepseek_v4_1_flash/decode_c2a_reuse.py -p a5 -d 0,1,2,3 \
  --tp 4 --tokens 33 --active-tokens 31 --requests 6 \
  --epochs 2 --save-data
```

Each validation epoch invokes the complete production composition: mHC
mixes/pre, input RMSNorm, one Attention call, and mHC post. Epochs repeat the
same fixture inputs for validation and benchmarking; they do not feed one
epoch's hidden or pre-mix output into the next. Validation reuses each leaf's
fixture, reference, and precision checks and checks updated caches and exact
non-owner storage.

mHC boundaries cover the full token capacity. Composition owns the temporary
collapsed and normalized Attention inputs. `attention_output` remains a
caller-initialized `InOut` because Reuse writes only the active prefix while
mHC post consumes the full capacity. The Reuse case validates inactive rows
with a nonzero sentinel. `attention_hidden` and `attention_pre_mix` are fully
written `Out` boundaries. Hidden precision statistics cover active rows only;
the inactive suffix is checked independently so it cannot dilute the active
error budget.

Full attention owns compressed KV and index-key publication. Reindex consumes
the C1A cache and the layer-20 candidate mask but computes a new index query.
Reuse consumes the source layer's physical Top-K rows and has no compressor or
indexer weights. The hierarchical indexer first selects 2,048 blocks of eight
compressed positions at layer 20; later reindex layers select their final 512
positions only inside that candidate mask.

Each decoder C1A mode keeps its attention operator in `decode_attn_c1a_*.py` and
adds an mHC-wired `decode_c1a_*.py` entry. V4.1 staggers the coefficients:
the entry collapses with the `pre_mix` the previous sub-layer produced (one-hot
lane zero at the very first site), applies this site's `post_mix` and
`residual_mix` immediately, and hands its own computed `pre_mix` to the next
sub-layer, so it returns the new streams and that coefficient. The full entry
also hosts the shared HC fixture, goldens, and validation harness the other two
entries reuse.

The final HC collapse has no learned head parameters: it applies the last
layer's delayed `pre_mix` directly to the four residual streams. HC mixes are
depth-local values and are not persisted as sequence state.

The production cache ABI uses a 128-token scheduler block and keeps payloads
quantized in HBM:

- Window KV payload: `[blocks, 128, 1, 512]`, MXFP8 E4M3, with
  `[blocks, 128, 1, 16]` E8M0 group-of-32 scales.
- Ratio-2 compressed KV payload: logical `[blocks, 128, 1, 512]` of **FP4**
  (4-bit E2M1) values, stored packed as **FP4E2M1X2** (two FP4 per byte; host
  `torch.float4_e2m1fn_x2`, physical last dim `256`), with
  `[blocks, 128, 1, 32]` E4M3 group-of-16 scales. Layers 2,
  8, and 14 own these pools; one physical row represents two original tokens.
- Ratio-1 compressed KV uses the same packed FP4 / FP4E2M1X2 payload and scale
  ABI and is owned by layer 20.
- Index-key payload: logical `[blocks, 128, 1, 128]` FP4 elements, packed as
  FP4E2M1X2 (physical last dim `64`), with
  `[blocks, 128, 1, 4]` E8M0 group-of-32 scales.
- Ratio-2 recurrent state: `[num_state_blocks, STATE_CAPACITY, 1024]`, FP32.
  Each row stores the token's 512-channel KV projection followed by its
  512-channel gate score. `STATE_CAPACITY` is a model configuration constant
  (currently 4), independent of context length and batch size. Ratio 1 has no
  recurrent compressor state.

Device kernels still annotate these packed payloads as `pl.UINT8` with the
physical (byte) last dimension. `pl.FP4` is the **scalar** 4-bit element type
(logical width); `FP4E2M1X2` / `float4_e2m1x2_t` is the **packed** one-byte
carrier for two FP4 values — they are not the same type. `pl.reinterpret_view`
does not yet support FP4↔UINT8 aliasing for the nibble publish/decode path, so
device annotation stays UINT8 this period.

Compressed KV and index-key tensors for a source share the same
`c{ratio}a_cmp_kv` block table. Compressor state uses a separate engine-owned
`state_block_table` and must never use the current batch row as its physical
address. Torch goldens quantize on cache publication and dequantize on cache
reads; BF16 cache values are only an intermediate reference representation,
not the kernel ABI.

### Compressor state ownership

C2A Full prefill and decode take the same state inputs:

| Input | Contract |
| --- | --- |
| `query_start_loc` | INT32 `[B + 1]`, starts at zero; nondecreasing packed query boundaries. Equal adjacent entries represent an empty request. |
| `position_ids` | INT32 `[T]`, nonnegative absolute positions, consecutive within each valid request chunk. |
| `token_to_req_indices` | INT32 `[T]`, the current batch row `r` for every token in `[query_start_loc[r], query_start_loc[r + 1])`. This is not a persistent request ID. |
| `state_block_table` | INT32 `[B, 1]`, a stable physical state block per request; `-1` disables that request's compressor. |
| `state_cache` | FP32 `[num_state_blocks, STATE_CAPACITY, 2 * HEAD_DIM]`, an inout ring owned by the source layer. |

`num_tokens` counts the valid packed prefix and equals `query_start_loc[-1]`;
`T` may include trailing storage padding. The standalone compressor accepts
`num_tokens=0` with a positive padded tensor extent: it performs no projection,
state or output accesses. Empty requests perform no state accesses. Invalid
request/block indices are checked before table/cache indexing; negative
positions suppress publication and state writes. A live request must have a
valid allocation; an invalid block does not provide meaningful compression.
Callers disable the corresponding compressed/index cache slots for inactive
tokens as well. The metadata builder produces only the packed valid prefix. The C2A rank
drivers skip the entire sublayer when `num_tokens=0`; TP peers within a DP
group must agree on whether that group is idle.

For each valid token at absolute position `p`, the compressor computes
`block = state_block_table[token_to_req_indices[t], 0]` and ring slot
`block * STATE_CAPACITY + p % STATE_CAPACITY`. An odd-position token closes a
pair. At the start of a chunk it reads the predecessor at
`(p - 1) % STATE_CAPACITY`; within a chunk it reads the preceding projection
directly. All historical reads complete before state writes. Only the last
`min(chunk_length, STATE_CAPACITY)` rows of a chunk are written, giving each
ring slot at most one writer even when the chunk is longer than the ring.
The pooling softmax, BF16 rounding before RMSNorm, and publication parity are
unchanged.

The engine retains the same physical block while a request changes batch row.
It may release/reassign a block only after that request's outstanding state
users complete; distinct live requests cannot write the same block. Layers
2, 8 and 14 own independent state caches. `ForwardMetadata.state_block_tables`
contains a separate engine-supplied table for each source, allowing either
shared block numbering across those pools or independent allocations. No
payload is shared between source layers; reuse layers use their source's
compressed outputs and do not update compressor state.

A new request starts at position zero with no pending pair. Old bytes in a
reused block are harmless only under this contract: its own even-position
projection is written before a later call consumes it. Resuming at an odd
position requires restoring or recomputing that request/source's matching
predecessor KV and gate state. Restoring only compressed KV, or zeroing state,
is insufficient. Ring storage does not implement speculative acceptance,
rollback, or prefix-state restoration; those remain engine responsibilities.

Indexer workspaces store physical flattened cache-row ids, padded with `-1`,
so separately scheduled window and compressed sparse-attention kernels do not
depend on a concatenated-cache offset. Candidate masks remain in request-local
compressed-position space.

`ForwardMetadata` lowers packed query starts, token-to-request indices, absolute positions,
previous/new KV lengths, cache slot mappings, sliding-window indices,
per-token causal compressed lengths, per-request compressed lengths and
remainders, ragged compressor output starts, source-token rows, and compressed
RoPE positions. The same lowering serves prefill and continuous-batch decode.

The target deployment is one eight-card A5 node with TP4 attention, two DP
groups, and EP8 routed experts. TP1/2/4/8 and compatible EP2/4/8 shapes remain
available for bring-up. The EP world is reinterpreted as `DP = EP / TP`
contiguous attention groups; `tp_rank = rank % TP` and
`group_base = rank - tp_rank`.

The first implementation targets pure head tensor parallelism. Every TP rank
sees the same token batch. `wq_a`, `wkv`, compressor, indexer, and the
single-head KV caches are replicated. `wq_b`, query heads, attention sinks,
and output groups are sharded across TP ranks. Each rank computes
16 query heads and two output groups; one FP32 TP all-reduce reconstructs the
complete hidden output. Before EP8 dispatch, token-row ownership is assigned
round-robin across the four TP ranks. This prevents replicated attention rows
from being dispatched four times; MoE combine returns the rows to the TP
layout. DSA context parallelism is intentionally out of scope.

The service capacity contract is 32 active sequences and 4,096 scheduled
prefill token rows per DP group. With five reserved DSpark draft rows plus one
target row, the decode ABI reserves 192 token rows per DP group. DP2 therefore
supports up to 64 active sequences globally. DSpark execution itself remains
follow-up work.

Query/output low-rank projections and shared experts use MXFP8 payloads.
Routed expert weights remain output-major packed MXFP4 (**FP4** elements in an
**FP4E2M1X2** host carrier with E8M0 group-of-32 scales) in the checkpoint.
The **current** device path still expands them to MXFP8 on the host via
`prepare_routed_weight_for_device` before HBM upload. The planned kernel that
loads one FP4 tile, casts that tile to FP8 on-chip, and uses the supported
MXFP8 Cube path is **not implemented yet** (see issue #1287); do not treat
host-side expansion as that on-chip cast path.

The paged-attention Torch reference accumulates the BF16 compressor, index-key,
index-weight, and grouped output projections in FP32. Compressor, index-key,
and grouped output results are rounded back to the activation dtype before
the next stage. The prefill C1A indexer rounds projected and scaled index
weights, QK dot products, weighted scores, and the head-reduction result to
BF16. Top-K scratch stores those rounded scores in FP32. The Torch reference
uses the same rounding boundaries.
This makes accumulation explicit rather than depending on the CPU backend's
native BF16 matrix multiplication.

C1A Full and Reindex, in both prefill and decode, temporarily order index-key
decoding after the index-weight projection completes
([pypto#2829](https://github.com/hw-native-sys/pypto/issues/2829)). On the pinned A5 stack,
a mixed projection's Cube producer can start while its paired Vector core
still executes a decoder, overwriting the decoder's UB through the local C2V
pipe. The explicit task dependency avoids this overlap at the cost of some
parallelism; it does not change the arithmetic or precision thresholds.
Reuse has no index-weight projection or index-key decoder.

For C1A prefill, the attention reference follows the kernel's 32-key online
softmax tiles, BF16 probability operand for PV, and FP32 correction of the
first 16 columns of the first head in each 16-head group. Each rank's final
projection remains FP32 through the rank-ordered TP reduction, with one BF16
cast after the sum.

Full and Reindex validate Top-K eligibility, uniqueness, logical-position
ordering, trailing `-1` padding, and cutoff score quality before checking
the output. If an accepted selection differs from the nominal golden, the
output reference is recomputed for that selection using the **reference
cache values and original weights**. Device cache contents and output values
do not define this reference. Reuse uses its supplied selection directly.

Every output row (one token on one rank) must satisfy both bounds:

```text
RMS(actual - reference) <= 1e-6 + 0.01 * RMS(reference)
max(abs(actual - reference)) <= 1e-5 + 0.05 * RMS(reference)
```

Non-finite values fail. There is no global outlier quota: a bad row cannot
be diluted by other tokens or ranks, and a small number of large finite
errors cannot bypass the peak bound. The absolute floors cover near-zero
rows. Cache comparisons retain their separate quantization and ownership
checks. Saved `data/out` snapshots encode the reference arithmetic and must
be regenerated after these rounding rules change.

At the maximum 1,048,576-token context, the low-bit attention cache is about
0.94 GB per request per card, compared with about 3.37 GB for BF16. At 32
requests this is about 30.2 GB/card instead of 107.8 GB/card. Ideal per-card
weight payload is about 66 GB before alignment and runtime workspaces: 36.1 GB
of EP8 routed experts, 25.3 GB of sharded Engram, and 4.7 GB of other TP4
weights. These figures make eight-card A5 deployment a plausible target, but
the issue remains open until a real-device run records peak HBM and generates
reference-matching text.

## Path to token generation

The implementation milestones are ordered by dependency:

1. Implement and compile the attention TP all-reduce, mHC, and SWA.
   Packed prefill SWA is wired through mHC: `mhc_mixes` → `mhc_pre` →
   `prefill_attn_swa` → `mhc_post`. Run `python models/deepseek_v4_1_flash/prefill_swa.py`.
2. Implement C2A Full, then validate Full-to-Reuse cache and Top-K replay.
   Packed prefill C2A Full and Reuse are wired through mHC the same way,
   with the attention RMSNorm the block runs between `mhc_pre` and the
   leaf: `python models/deepseek_v4_1_flash/prefill_c2a_full.py`.
3. Implement C1A Full and the level-one candidate selector, then Reindex and Reuse.
4. Implement the three-phase EP-MoE dispatch/local-expert/combine body.
5. Compose the operators into the 40-layer prefill/decode token loop.

Until the leaf kernels and weight loader land, this directory is not a runnable
model and is not exposed to `pypto-serving`.

The compressor ownership regression can run without devices:

```bash
python -m pytest tests/contract/test_v41_compressor_state.py -q
python tests/contract/test_v41_compressor_state.py -p a5sim
```

The second command runs two consecutive kernel calls with reordering, block
reuse, a chunk longer than the ring, inactive requests, trailing padding, and
an empty-work case. Use `-p a5 -d <allocated_device>` for the same test on a
real A5 device. Full attention validation additionally uses
`decode_c2a_full.py` and `prefill_c2a_full.py`; their fixtures use nonidentity
state block mappings.
